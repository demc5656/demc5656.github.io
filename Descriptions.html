    <p>(9/7/21 15:49) Read the Basics of the Web articles listed under the Portfolio Description assignment. I actually found it interesting that a webpage and a website are conceptually different. I always thought they were interchangable, but I suppose they are not having read those. A Website is like a table of contents or a main point that connects to other webpages. They are the SITE at which other webpages are stored. At least, that's how I interpreted it.</p>
    <p>(9/7/21 16:06) Unsure if this much is visible, but Dr. Bart mentioned that .md files also work out with <strong>HTML</strong> tags. So I decided I should try and see if the angle brackets around the p & /p and it seems to have worked!</p>
    <p>(9/9/21 12:02) I made a little reference sheet for myself while practicing super basic <strong>HTML</strong>. Might improve upon it, but for now here's a link to <a href="https://demc5656.github.io/Test.html">Test.html</a>!</p>
    <p>(9/9/21 17:55) Image embedding practice page with <strong>HTML</strong> for some art I made at <a href="https://demc5656.github.io/coolartimade.html">coolartimade.html</a>. If you send someone an image via Discord, when you click on the preview of it you have the option to "Open Original" on the bottom. If you hit that it opens your image in your browser. From there copy the link and use between angle brackets img src="image link you copied"/ I managed to get that to work for this one I drew and uploaded as a test.</p>
    <p>(9/9/21 18:58) <strong>CSS</strong> Color changes to <a href="https://demc5656.github.io/Test.html">Test.html</a></p>
    <p>(9/14/21 16:01) Added bolding to descriptions using strong.</p>
    <p>(9/14/21 19:25) Added tab icons to the non-README.md files (didn't work on README.md). Looked up how to do that <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26445755/html-add-icon-to-browser-tab">here</a>. The icon itself is something I made a while back as an emote on a personal Discord server. Seems to be <strong>HTML</strong>.</a></p>
    <p>(9/15/21 11:00) Resized the original image on <a href="https://demc5656.github.io/coolartimade.html">coolartimade.html</a> and added a second image (AKA the tab icon).</p>
    <p>(9/16/21 15:10) Added <strong>React App</strong> for testing out <strong>TypeScript</strong> and maybe making a more complicated app later but for now just messing around with it <a href="https://demc5656.github.io/my-app/">here</a> and here's the <a href="https://github.com/demc5656/my-app">source code</a>.</p>
    <p>(9/16/21 15:43) Did a little customization of the basic <strong>React App</strong> including the piece of art on both the tab icons and <a href="https://demc5656.github.io/coolartimade.html">coolartimade.html</a>. Also changed the text to say the app is unfinished, made the background black rather than gray, and changed the rotate speed to 30s rather than the default 20s.</p>
    <p>(9/16/21 15:56) The branches are confusing. I rarely struggle with Git but branches don't make much sense. I think that's a problem for next week... As a result the app isn't deploying with my changes for some reason... You can find a screenshot <a href="https://demc5656.github.io/coolartimade.html">here</a> with my art.</p>
    <p>(9/16/21 18:19) Branches were not the problem. I forgot to deploy my app. Fixed that with Dr. Bart's help and now it's working properly. I'll leave the screenshot though. <a href="https://demc5656.github.io/my-app/">Here's the link.</Head></a></p>
