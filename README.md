Read the Basics of the Web articles listed under the Portfolio Description assignment. I actually found it interesting that a webpage and a website are conceptually different. I always thought they were interchangable, but I suppose they are not having read those. A Website is like a table of contents or a main point that connects to other webpages. they are the SITE at which other webpages are stored. At least, that's how I interpreted it. (15:49 9/7/21)

<p>Unsure if this much is visible, but Dr. Bart mentioned that .md files also work out with HTML tags. So I decided I should try and see if the angle brackets around the p & /p and it seems to have worked!</p> (16:06 9/7/21)

I made a little reference sheet for myself while practicing super basic HTML. Might improve upon it, but for now here's a link to <a href="https://demc5656.github.io/Test.html">Test.html</a>!

# TODO
Figure out Git Merges (just in case)
