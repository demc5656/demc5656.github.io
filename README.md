Read the Basics of the Web articles listed under the Portfolio Description assignment. I actually found it interesting that a webpage and a website are conceptually different. I always thought they were interchangable, but I suppose they are not having read those. A Website is like a table of contents or a main point that connects to other webpages. they are the SITE at which other webpages are stored. At least, that's how I interpreted it. (15:49 9/7/21)

<p>Unsure if this much is visible, but Dr. Bart mentioned that .md files also work out with HTML tags. So I decided I should try and see if the angle brackets around the p & /p and it seems to have worked! (16:06 9/7/21)</p>

I made a little reference sheet for myself while practicing super basic HTML. Might improve upon it, but for now here's a link to <a href="https://demc5656.github.io/Test.html">Test.html</a>! (12:02 9/9/21)

Image embedding practice page with HTML for some art I made at <a href="https://demc5656.github.io/coolartimade.html">coolartimade.html</a>. If you send someone an image via Discord, when you click on the preview of it you have the option to "Open Original" on the bottom. If you hit that it opens your image in your browser. From there copy the link and use between angle brackets img src="image link you copied"/
I managed to get that to work for this one I drew and uploaded as a test. (17:55 9/9/21)

CSS Color changes to <a href="https://demc5656.github.io/Test.html">Test.html</a> (18:58 9/9/21)
