Read the Basics of the Web articles listed under the Portfolio Description assignment. I actually found it interesting that a webpage and a website are conceptually different. I always thought they were interchangable, but I suppose they are not having read those. A Website is like a table of contents or a main point that connects to other webpages. they are the SITE at which other webpages are stored. At least, that's how I interpreted it.

<p>Unsure if this much is visible, but Dr. Bart mentioned that .md files also work out with HTML tags. So I decided I should try and see if the angle brackets around the p & /p and it seems to have worked!</p>
